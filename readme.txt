Project: Phosphorus Use Efficiency in wheat plants
No. of genotypes = 
No. of treatments = 2 (0kg and 30kg of phosphorus)
No. of replicates = 2
No. of trials = 3 (in different locations: Ardlethan, York and Wallaroo)
Data: Grain yield, dry biomass (to be determined from grab sample), total chemical elemental compositions of shoots and grains (from the pXRF)
	- 1 file for grain yield for York
	- 1 file of grab sampling containing dry weight and grain weight
	- 5 files for pXRF_SampleIDs that will be used to link pXRF_data to field data files

Aims: To identify the high performing genotypes in each treatment, then select the ones with the least difference between the two treatments

Objectives:
1. Tidy-up data: (Sample processing still in progress – only about 400 samples will be analysed)
	
- 1.1 Working with the pXRF_SampleIDs files
	- 1.1.1 Check data type/structure in each file
	- 1.1.2 Join all files
